<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lithium Ores Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Saline Lake lithium</li><li>Mineral</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The lithium ores market consists of two main types: saline lake lithium and mineral lithium. Saline lake lithium is extracted from brine solutions found in salt flats, where evaporation concentrates lithium over time. This method is generally more cost-effective and sustainable. In contrast, mineral lithium is sourced from hard rock deposits, primarily spodumene. This extraction process is more complex and involves mining and refining but yields higher lithium concentrations. Both types cater to the growing demand for lithium in batteries and electric vehicles.</p></p>
