<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Marine Bunker Oil Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Residual Fuel</li><li>Distillate Fuel</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The marine bunker oil market is primarily divided into two types: residual fuel and distillate fuel. Residual fuel, also known as heavy fuel oil, is less refined and commonly used in large vessels due to its cost-effectiveness, despite producing higher emissions. Distillate fuel, including marine gas oil, is lighter and cleaner, making it suitable for smaller vessels and those operating in stricter environmental regulations. The choice between these fuels largely depends on vessel type, operational requirements, and regulatory compliance.</p></p>
