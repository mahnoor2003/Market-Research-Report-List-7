<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Manual Defibrillator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Phase Defibrillator</li><li>Biphasic Defibrillator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The manual defibrillator market is primarily categorized into single-phase and biphasic defibrillators. Single-phase defibrillators deliver a single electrical shock to the heart, often leading to a higher risk of myocardial damage. Conversely, biphasic defibrillators administer shocks that change direction during the discharge, resulting in more effective resuscitation with lower energy levels. The biphasic approach is generally preferred in modern medical settings due to its improved efficacy and reduced adverse effects on cardiac tissue.</p></p>
