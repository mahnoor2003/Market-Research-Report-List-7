<p><ul><li>Wet Fire Sprinkler System</li><li>Dry Fire Sprinkler System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fire sprinkler pipes and fittings market serves crucial applications in wet and dry fire sprinkler systems. Wet fire sprinkler systems constantly maintain water in the pipes, providing immediate response to fires, making them ideal for buildings with adequate temperature control. In contrast, dry fire sprinkler systems use pressurized air to keep pipes empty until activated, making them suitable for unheated spaces where freezing is a risk. Both systems enhance fire safety in residential, commercial, and industrial environments.</p></p>
