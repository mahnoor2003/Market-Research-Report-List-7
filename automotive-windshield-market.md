<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Windshield Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Laminated Glass</li><li>Tempered Glass</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive windshield market primarily includes laminated and tempered glass types. Laminated glass features a layer of polyvinyl butyral (PVB) sandwiched between two glass sheets, providing enhanced safety by preventing shattering upon impact. It also offers noise reduction and UV protection. In contrast, tempered glass is heat-treated for strength and shatters into small, blunt pieces, reducing injury risks. While tempered glass is often used for side and rear windows, laminated glass is the preferred choice for windshields due to its protective properties.</p></p>
